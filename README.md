# IPI R
 Learning and Developing R Programming
After watching a lot of YouTube videos I turned to the 1st book in 3 I will study. I was most impressed with the speed and smooth handling of delimited file uploads to both SQL Server andd MySql by RODBC. SQL Server flatfile import tasks were often prone to failurs and MySql took some 30 minutes to import an incomplete data set as opposed to RODBC taking 30 to 50 seconds at most on a full data set. As usual, I have taken my studies a little bit further and altered the examples given. A good example of this is the Blackjack example https://ipi-international.shinyapps.io/IPI_R-Blackjack/
