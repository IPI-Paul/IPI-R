Although the Power Query in Excel and the ability of Word 2013+ to open PDF files gets closer to allowing people in finance roles to automate data retrieval for the invoice

The attached PDF is not a true representation of what to expect when extracting tables from the numerous Statements and Invoices in finance, but it gives a good testing ground to 
learn the effectiveness of R Programming libraries in comparison to Excel's Power Query, Word converters and Adobe's export to Excel functions.
